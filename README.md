# NESS
A Nintendo Entertainment System emulator made in Python

One of the 5 million NES emulators currently out there.
Initially, I wanted to make an SNES emulator that could run Earthbound on it (Hence the name NESS, anagram of SNES and name of Earthbound's protagonist) but I realized I was nowhere
near skilled enough to achieve that, so settled on the NES instead. Maybe I will add a SNES emulator to this project eventually, who knows.

The goal was just to make a functioning emulator as a fun learning project, utilizing a high level language. This is not intended to be performant or very accurate, or planned to be 
a solid alternative to the already established emulators out there. It is just to see how much I can get away with using a high level language and my shoddy coding skills while relying on 
the processing power of modern computers to compensate for it.
